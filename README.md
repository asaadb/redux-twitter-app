# Redux Twitter App?


## Project Overview

This is a simple web app similar to twitter. The user can see all the tweets on his our her timeline. The user can post a tweet, replay to a tweet, and like other tweets. The user can also replay to replies.

## Installing

* Run the following code to install the development dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

 ```

```

To run the project in the **production mode**:
* Run:
```
